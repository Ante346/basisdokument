## About

This app enables lawyers and judges to create their previous analogue correspondence in a digital environment. It offers a variety of useful features that aim to ease the process of working on cases while also making the process more time efficient. The app is based on the works of the last semester by [Hahn, Röhr & Sautmann (2021)](https://github.com/kindOfCurly/PS-Basisdokument/wiki/Projekt-Log) and [Freisleben, Schwarz & Zels (2021)](https://elearning.uni-regensburg.de/mod/resource/view.php?id=2172773) The division of the prototypes from previous semesters was discarded due to the newly emerged requirements. All previous and new requirements have been merged into one application that can be used by all parties (Plaintiff, Defendant, Judge). The app allows them to create and edit a "Basisdokument". The current list of features can be seen in the corresponding [Wiki](https://github.com/markusbink/basisdokument-implementierung/wiki/07-Beschreibung-der-Anwendung).

## Motivation

The working group "Modernization of Civil Procedure" has "extensively examined how new technical possibilities can be used in civil procedure in order to make court procedures more citizen-friendly, efficient and resource-saving". [[1]](https://www.brak.de/newsroom/newsletter/nachrichten-aus-berlin/2021/ausgabe-2-2021-v-2712021/modernisierung-des-zivilprozesses-diskussionspapier-der-olg-praesidenten/)
The working group's proposal is a digital document that serves to structure the party speech and eases the communication process between parties.
